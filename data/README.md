# Data for replication

For computational experiments on multiechelon supply chain in Section 2.3

- data_case_1.zip contains the data for Case 1 with 3 suppliers. Each data file contains 3 columns and each column indicates the disruption status of a supplier. The data is generated by file case1_datagen.py.

- data_case_2.zip contains the data for Case 2 with 4 suppliers. Each data file contains 4 columns and each column indicates the disruption status of a supplier. The data is generated by file case2_datagen.py.

For computational experiments in Section 4.4

- numeric.zip contains the data. Each data file is named as data_[1]_\[2\]_[3].txt where [1] is either c for random capacity or y for random yield; [2] in {5,10,15} correpsonds to theta {-1,0,1} respectively, and [3] is the sample index from 0 to 99. Each data file includes: the CDF values for each supplier, the covariance matrix for each kappa, and the cost.
